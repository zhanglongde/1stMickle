//Since Node.js is by default a single thread application,
//    it will run on a single processor core
//and will not take full advantage of multiple core resources. However,
//    Node.js provides support for deployment on multiple-core systems,
//    to take greater advantage of the hardware. The Cluster module is one of the core Node.js modules
//and it allows running multiple Node.js worker processes that will share the same port.
