    <h1>Law of Similarity</h1>
    <p>The Gestalt Law of Similarity states that entities that look similar tend to be grouped together. For example, if all clickable texts are sky-blue, the audience will assume that all textual content that is sky-blue is clickable.

        In typography, the law of similarity just means to keep your styles consistent on elements that serve the same function. Group of elements should also look similar to other groups that serve the same function, for example: the visual styles of one blog post should look similar to another blog post. On the other hand, elements with a different functions should not look similar to one another.</p>
    <h1>Law of Proximity</h1>
    <p>
        To master the positioning of elements, it is crucial to understand the Gestalt Law of Proximity. The Law of Proximity states that humans perceive objects that are closer together as related objects. And vice versa, objects that are farther apart are perceived as different groups.
